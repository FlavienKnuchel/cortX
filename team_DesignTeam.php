        	<h2>Mara Sandoval</h2>
			<p>
                Mara is a Mexican-Swiss hybrid who was born in Germany, raised in Mexico City, California, and Switzerland. She studied anthropology and then communication design, has worked at Hallmark Cards, UNICEF and the World Economic Forum. Mara is co-founder of <a title="CIAN AGENCY Â¦ AN IMAGE FOR YOUR CAUSE" href="http://www.cianagency.com/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.cianagency.com']);" target="_blank">CIAN Agency</a>, a company that matches awesome photography with clients who are looking for strong visual communication solutions. Mara is part of the coordination team for the TEDxLausanne 2013 event as well as head of the design team. She works on anything creative, makes speaker suggestions, sources, and occasionally gives the communication team a hand. Mara spends all her money on traveling, pays special attention to patterns and connections in everything that surrounds her, likes to see the big picture and would like to recommend &#8220;Electrified Sheep&#8221; by Alex Boese because it is currently her favorite book.

			<h2>Yann Lauber</h2>
			<p>
            	A sort of creative who loves to dream, Yann was born and raised in Lausanne. He is a person always open to explore, ready to learn new things, challenge, discover new cultures, and meet new people. This openness and natural curiosity has led to jobs in various disciplines. He has been a lifeguard, a roofer, a vendor in a ski resort, and a cameraman. He loves sports and for over twenty years he has played ice hockey and completed dozens of triathlons. Yann designs and creates the graphics for our TEDxLausanne 2013 event including those for our website, posters, business cards, and t-shirts. Currently, he has his own graphic design company (<a href="http://www.laubergraphics.com/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.laubergraphics.com']);" target="_blank">Lauber GraphicDesign</a>) and has found in his profession all the ingredients that make it more of a passion than a job: diversity, discovery, rigor, aesthetics, fun, and creativity.

			<h2>Christophe Constantin</h2>
			<p>
            	Christophe studies art at the Ecole cantonale d&#8217;art du Valais (ECAV). He is highly interested in the relation between life and art. For his work, he takes over and rearranges urban or design objects, and changes their use. He thereby questions the audience on our society. Inspired by that idea, he conceived the scenery of TEDx Lausanne 213 as well as all graphical elements. Art is a passion that he wishes to teach in the near future.
