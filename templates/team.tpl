            <h1>The TEDxLausanne team</h1>
            <p>The TEDxLausanne 2013 team of organizers consists of 30 highly-motivated volunteers from very varied backgrounds. Their goal, beyond teaming up to organize an unforgettable event, is to offer a stage to people with innovative and engaging ideas and projects. Beyond the organisation of TEDxLausanne, the volunteers behind the event form a fresh and dynamic community, always evolving and in search for new ideas and projects to share.
