			<h2>Serge Piguet</h2>
            <h3>host</h3>
			<p>
            	Youngest in a family of three boys, Serge learned very quickly to find his own path. After training as a draftsman, followed by a visit to the HES in Architecture, he actually founded a church in Geneva. Growing rapidly, the congregation became a structure requiring a commitment. Serge is a part-time pastor. To support his commitment, he left architecture and gained a foothold in sales. His head is full of ideas and projects. Today, his church continues to evolve without him and after six years as a manager in retail, he now devotes 100% of his time as a trainer and project manager. His curiosity and desire to learn naturally lead to TEDxLausanne.
