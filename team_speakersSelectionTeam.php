            <p>
            	Gerald is an MD specialized in infectious disease control and prevention with an MSc in Health Policy, Planning and Financing. With experience in outbreak prevention and bio-terrorism preparedness, he joined the World Health Organization (WHO) to address unsafe health care.

            <h2>Adria Le Boeuf</h2>
            <p>
            	Adria is a Californian slowly migrating east through New York City and now lives in Lausanne. With a PhD in neuroscience and biophysics, she is using ant colonies to study emergent decision-making in social networks at the University of Lausanne. Adria also leads a cross-disciplinary theater group for scientists here in Lausanne to help breakdown stereotypes of scientists and broaden creative expression. Adria is part of the TEDxLausanne 2013 Speakers Team, specifically focusing on science and performance speakers. Adria is passionate about spreading the beauty of science to everyone and she feels TEDxLausanne is an excellent means to do that. Adria also loves to sing, to speak with different accents, and to explore the in-between spaces separating seemingly different ideas.
            </p>
            <h2>Michelle Blanchet</h2>
            <p>
            	Michelle is a Virginia native who’s lived all over the US. She recently moved from Spain to Switzerland and landed a job she loves:  teaching sociology, psychology, and economics. As an educator passionate about social entrepreneurship and social innovation she works on projects that help spread great ideas. She’s worked with Ashoka Suisse Romande, Sonjabe.com, Young Changers, Social innovation Europe, and recently became a co-founder of Change Fusion Europe. Michelle spends her spare time traveling, trying new things, and writing. She’s written a slew of short stories (if you ever want to take a peak!LINK?). As a new edition to the TEDxLausanne speaker’s team, she’s excited to help the team identify great speakers and is happy to contribute to whatever needs to be done to make the event a success.
            </p>
            <h2>Nora Cantini</h2>
            <p>
            	Nora aims to contribute to the performance and well-being of companies through motivated, responsible, empowered individuals and teams. Currently, as People Development Manager in a telecommunications company, she defines and delivers programmes, concepts and workshops that enable management, talents, women and employees to evolve, develop and progress in their professional lives. She also has a Master’s in Environmental Management, and believes that seeing systems and interactions between elements is crucial to finding viable solutions for our world. Of Swiss, Italian, and U.S. nationalities, Nora has always lived and worked in multi-cultural environments.  Diversity drives her on-going learning and her passion for working in processes of innovation and transformation.
            </p>
            <h2>Samuel Lagier</h2>
            <p>
            	Samuel is a neuroscientist studying the sense of smell in normal and pathological (schizophrenic) animal models at the University of Geneva. He previously worked in Paris and New York before landing in Switzerland. Samuel has a keen interest in bringing the knowledge and excellence of science to the public, TEDxLausanne being an excellent framework for that. As a member of the TEDxLausanne speakers team, he is looking for the ideas worth spreading. Nature is an endless source of motivation and inspiration for him. He is thus interested in traveling, nature preservation and sustainability issues. Hand him some juggling material and you&#8217;ll have a surprise.

She&#8217;s worked in design, brand strategy, and consumer insights for over 15 years &#8211; talking to people, deriving insights and helping global businesses grow through consumer understanding. Highly energised by creative environments, she was excited to meet Simon at a Career Fair event she led at EPFL, and is now working with Sparks Training to lead the &#8220;Idea Bubbles&#8221; initiative for TEDx Lausanne. Though not her claim to fame, she married three times (fortunately to the same man) in different cultural contexts and is always game to share that &#8220;It&#8217;s a small world after all!&#8221;
