        <h1>About TED</h1>			
		<p>
        <a href="http://www.ted.com/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.ted.com']);">TED</a> is a nonprofit organization devoted to &#8220;ideas worth spreading&#8221;. Started in 1984 in California as a four-day conference about Technology, Entertainment, Design, TED has broadened its scope and grown to support those world-changing ideas with multiple initiatives. At TED, the world’s leading thinkers and doers are asked to give the talk of their lives in 18 minutes. Talks are then made available for free at <a href="http://www.ted.com" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.ted.com']);">TED.com</a>. TED speakers have included Bill Gates, Jane Goodall, Elizabeth Gilbert, Sir Richard Branson, Benoit Mandelbrot, Philippe Starck, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Isabel Allende and Gordon Brown. Two major TED events are held each year: The TED Conference takes place every spring in Long Beach, California (along with a parallel conference, TEDActive, in Palm Springs), and TEDGlobal is held each summer in Edinburgh, Scotland.
        </p>

			TED’s media initiatives include <a href="http://www.ted.com" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.ted.com']);">TED.com</a>, where new TEDTalks are posted daily; the new TED Conversations, enabling broad conversations among TED fans; and the Open Translation Project, which provides subtitles and interactive transcripts as well as the ability for any TEDTalk to be translated by volunteers worldwide.
		</p>
		<p>
        	TED has established the annual TED Prize, where exceptional individuals with a wish to change the world are given the opportunity to put their wishes into action; TEDx, which offers individuals or groups a way to host local, self-organized events around the world; and the TED Fellows program, helping world-changing innovators from around the globe to become part of the TED community and, with its help, amplify the impact of their remarkable projects and activities.
